# AI Capstone CNN–Vision Transformer Land Classification

## Overview
This project implements and evaluates a hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for land classification using satellite imagery.

The pipeline demonstrates how convolutional neural networks extract local spatial features while Vision Transformers model global context through self-attention.

## Key Features
- CNN-based feature extraction
- Vision Transformer for global context modeling
- Implementations in both Keras (TensorFlow) and PyTorch
- Comparative evaluation across frameworks

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Core implementations and evaluation notebooks
- `models/` – Model architecture information
- `data/` – Dataset description (no raw data included)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch
- Vision Transformers (ViT)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Notes
This repository focuses on architectural design and evaluation. Datasets and trained model weights are excluded for size and licensing reasons.
